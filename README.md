# Digital Data Analysis, Report 2
This GitHub repository contains all the codes that have been used during the Report n.2 of the Digital Data Analysis course. The codes are described in the following lines following the natural workflow that has guided the writing session of the Report n.2 too.

## 1. "datapreprocessing.ipynb"
In this notebook data has been preprocessed: the mean value of the data and a linear fit has been subtracted by the original data. Moreover an hanning window has been applied

## 2. "fouriermethod.ipynb"
Time independent Fourier Analysis has been performed. By the usage of an opportune filter, a forecast has been made.

## 3. "fouriermethod2.ipynb" 
Time dependent Fourier Analysis has been performed. By the usage of an opportune filter, a forecast has been made.

## 4. "waveletfiltering.ipynb" 
A wavelet filter has been adopted to clean the signal. 

## 5. "SARIMA.ipynb"
Sarima and Arima processes have been made in order to perform a forecast on the dataset that has been cleaned by the wavelet filtering.

## 6. "Deconvolution.ipynb"
A deconvolution algorithm has been applied and a forecast has been made on the last year available (2016)
